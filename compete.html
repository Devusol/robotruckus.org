                              <h4>Important Note</h4>
                              <p>When registering for Maker Faire Orlando, the forms are designed for maker exhibits, and so the terminology needs a bit of translation.
                                The "Maker" is the team, and the "Exhibit" is the robot or robots. Each "maker" will get one pass to the event, and after you are approved,
                                you will be able to add "helpers" for the rest of your team to get everyone passes.
                                You do not need to register each member of your team as a maker, and if you have more than one robot, you are welcome to do all of them in one exhibit -
                                or break them into separate exhibits, your choice.<br><br>If you have questions on this registration, you can email us
                                at contact@robotruckus.org OR email the broader Maker Faire Orlando team at makers@makerfaireorlando.com<br><br>We know that registering on both buildersdb AND
                                the Maker Faire Orlando site is a lot of process, and we appreciate you helping us make it happen.</p>
